# Personal keymap for Sofle Keyboard rev1

Originally based on HellSing's keymap. https://github.com/HellSingCoder

Features:

- QWERTY keymap mimicking es-la keymap over a en-us keymap:
  - Mostly mapped to emit most symbols a es-la keymap would in simlar positions.
  - Emits symbols ñ, Ñ, ¿, ¡ by using SEND_STRING.
  - Dead keys for acute, grave accent and dieresis ... pending.


- Right encoder:
  - Volume up/down, mute when pushed.
  - Defining behavior with modifiers.
- Left encoder:
  - Brightness up/dow, media play/stop when pushed.
  - CTRL + encoder: horizontal mouse wheel left/right.

- Keypad layer.

- OLED is mostly the same as HellSing's.

- Space cadet ... postponed.
  - SHIFT: ()
  - CONTROL: []
  - ALT: {}
  - lower/raise: <> ... pending.


TODO:
- Add dead keys, if possible.
- Add space-cadet-ish behavior on lower/raise keys.
- Reduce memory footprint!!
